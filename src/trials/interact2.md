*[ICH]: Intracerebral Hemorrhage

## The Gist

INTERACT-2 was the first large, multicenter randomized trial to evaluate the effect of rapidly lowering blood pressure to a specific target in patients presenting with acute ICH.

‍**2839 patients** who presented within 6 hours of symptom onset were randomized to achieve a blood pressure target of **< 180 mm Hg** (at the time, considered [guideline-based treatment](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.183689) or **< 140 mm Hg (intensive blood pressure control)**.

At 90 days, 56% of patients in the guideline-recommended group were dead or severely disabled, compared to 52% of patients in the intensive-treatment group **(OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 - 1.01)**. The results of this trial suggest that blood pressure lowering to a target of < 140 mm Hg has a small but probable effect in reducing death and major disability.

A similar trial, [ATACH-2](/trials/atach-2/), was published several years later. While the trial failed to replicate the findings of INTERACT2, this may be due to differences in target SBP and duration of blood pressure control.

## Background and Clinical Context

The onset of ICH is often accompanied by an acute hypertensive response, which can reach very high levels and is associated with hematoma expansion and poor outcome. Clinicians are also concerned that lowering blood pressure too drastically may result in decreased cerebral perfusion, especially in perihematomal tissue.

[Previous AHA/ASA Guidelines](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.183689) recommended maintaining an SBP < 180 and/or a MAP < 110 to balance reducing the risk of hematoma expansion and maintaining an adequate cerebral perfusion pressure. However, this was not based on any robust evidence as no high-quality observational studies or randomized trials had been conducted.

INTERACT-2 was the first randomized trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of early intensive lowering of blood pressure on clinical outcomes.
