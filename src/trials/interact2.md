## The Gist

INTERACT-2 was the first large, multicenter randomized trial to evaluate the effect of rapidly lowering blood pressure to a specific target in patients presenting with acute primary ICH.

‍2839 patients who presented within 6 hours of symptom onset were randomized to achieve a blood pressure target of < 180 mmHg (at the time, considered [guideline-based treatment](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.183689)) or < 140 mmHg (intensive blood pressure control).

At 90 days, 56% of patients in the guideline-recommended group were dead or severely disabled, compared to 52% of patients in the intensive-treatment group (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 - 1.01). The results of this trial suggest that **blood pressure lowering to a target of < 140 mmHg likely has a small to moderate effect in reducing death and major disability**.

A similar trial, [ATACH-2](/trials/atach-2/), was published several years later. While the trial failed to replicate the findings of INTERACT2, this may be due to differences in target SBP and duration of blood pressure control.

## Background and Clinical Context

The onset of ICH is often accompanied by an acute hypertensive response, which can reach very high levels and is associated with hematoma expansion and poor outcome. Clinicians are also concerned that lowering blood pressure too drastically may result in decreased cerebral perfusion, especially in perihematomal tissue.

[Previous AHA/ASA Guidelines](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.183689) recommended maintaining an SBP < 180 and/or a MAP < 110 to balance reducing the risk of hematoma expansion and maintaining an adequate cerebral perfusion pressure. However, this was not based on any robust evidence as no high-quality observational studies or randomized trials had been conducted.

INTERACT-2 was the first randomized trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of early intensive lowering of blood pressure on clinical outcomes.

## Patient Population

Patients were included if they presented with an ICH **within 6 hours of onset and had an initial systolic blood pressure of 150-220 mmHg**. Patients were excluded if they had an admission GCS of 3-5, were perceived to have a poor prognosis, or if early hematoma evacuation was planned.

The mean age of the population was about 63 years of age, with 2/3 being male and 2/3 also being recruited from China.

**Most patients had mild ICH**: median GCS was 14 (IQR 12 - 15), median NIHSS was 10 (IQR 6 - 15) and median hematoma volume 11 mL (IQR 6-19) with approximately one-third of bleeds having intraventricular extension and the vast majority with a deep hematoma location (83%).

Only about 7% of patients were intubated and 3% of patients had an EVD.

## Final Thoughts

Blood Pressure trials or similar interventions are hard to conduct

People already had strong feelings about this given that the average BP was not much higher than 150 mmHg

While p-value did not cross the magical 0.05 threshold, the results were consistent with a beneficial effect of intensive blood pressure.

Don't know what to do with the QoL measures, as they were missing for many patients, and this likely was not at random.

Who are these people giving mannitol to patients that don't have IVH, are not intubated, and seem to have a fine GCS?

Hematoma expansion was not "significantly" reduced in the intensive group, but this may have been under powered.
