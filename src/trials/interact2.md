## The Gist

INTERACT-2 was the first large, multicenter randomized trial to evaluate the effect of rapidly lowering blood pressure to a specific target in patients presenting with acute primary ICH.

‍2839 patients who presented within 6 hours of symptom onset were randomized to achieve a blood pressure target of < 180 mmHg (at the time, considered [guideline-based treatment](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.183689)) or < 140 mmHg (intensive blood pressure control).

At 90 days, 56% of patients in the guideline treatment group died or were severely disabled, compared to 52% of patients in the intensive treatment group (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 - 1.01). The results of this trial suggest that **blood pressure lowering to a target of < 140 mmHg probably has a small effect in reducing death and major disability in patients presenting with ICH**.

A similar trial, [ATACH-2](/trials/atach-2/), was published several years later. While the trial failed to replicate the findings of INTERACT-2, [this may be due to differences in achieved blood pressure and duration of blood pressure control](/trials/interact-2/#putting-things-together).

## Clinical Context

The onset of ICH is often accompanied by an acute hypertensive response, which can reach very high levels and is associated with hematoma expansion and poor outcome. This relationship led to the theory that rapidly lowering blood pressure may reduce the risk of hematoma expansion and thus lower the risk of a poor outcome. 

On the other hand, the potential benefit in reducing blood pressure must be balanced with the perceived risk of worsening cerebral perfusion, especially in patients with longstanding hypertension. 

[Previous AHA/ASA Guidelines](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.183689) recommended maintaining an SBP < 180 and/or a MAP < 110 to balance reducing the risk of hematoma expansion and maintaining an adequate cerebral perfusion pressure. However, this was not based on any robust evidence as no high-quality studies had been conducted.

Published in 2013, INTERACT-2 was the first randomized trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of early intensive lowering of blood pressure on clinical outcomes.

## Patient Population

Patients were included if they presented with an ICH **within 6 hours of onset and had an initial systolic blood pressure of 150-220 mmHg**. Patients were excluded if they had an admission GCS of 3-5, were perceived to have a poor prognosis, or if early hematoma evacuation was planned.

The mean age of the population was about 63 years of age, with 2/3 being male and 2/3 also being recruited from China. Patients were also recruited from Europe, the United States, India, and South America.

**Most patients had mild ICH**: median GCS was 14 (IQR 12 - 15), median NIHSS was 10 (IQR 6 - 15) and median hematoma volume 11 mL (IQR 6-19) with approximately one-third of bleeds having intraventricular extension and the vast majority with a deep hematoma location (83%).

Only about 7% of patients were intubated and 3% of patients had an EVD.

## Study Design

This was an international trial involving > 100 sites with a **PROBE** design.

### Protocol

Patients were randomized to either one of two groups:

**Interventional Group**: intensive blood pressure control with goal SBP < 140. 

This goal was chosen based on previous observational studies demonstrating that a target SBP < 140-150 is associated with less frequent hematoma expansion compared to a target SBP < 160-170.

**Control Group**: guideline-recommended blood pressure control with goal SBP < 180. This was based on contemporary AHA guidelines. No lower limit was specified.

Both groups were recommended to achieve goal SBP **within 1 hour of randomization and maintaining this goal for the next 7 days**. The specific medications used to control blood pressure were left to pre-specified local protocols, although it was recommended that the initial agent used for the intensive treatment group be an IV medication, while the initial one for the guideline treatment group be an oral medication.

All patients were cared for in an acute stroke unit.

A subset of patients (planned sample size of 600 patients, 300 Asian and 300 non-Asian) underwent repeat brain imaging at 24 hours to evaluate for any differences in hematoma expansion.

### Power Analysis

The trial was designed to have at least 90% power to detect a **14% RRR** and **7% ARR** in the primary outcome of mRS 3-6 at 90 days, assuming event rates of 50% in the control group and 43% in the intervention group.

### Risk of Bias Analysis

## Results

### Achieved Blood Pressure

When a trial's main premise depends on manipulating a physiologic parameter, it's important to examine the achieved targets of said parameter. 

In INTERACT-2, there was decent separation between the two groups as shown in the supplemental figure below. Note that the patients in the guideline treatment group had a mean SBP of around 150 mmHg, drastically lower than the < 180 mmHg target. This likely reflects that clinicians were already targeting an SBP goal lower than the AHA recommended level prior to the start of this trial (or they were influenced by the results of the pilot INTERACT trial).

### Death or Major Disability

The primary outcome of **mRS at 90 days** after symptom onset was dichotomized between 0-2 (good outcome) versus 3-6 (poor outcome). When analyzed this way, 56% of patients in the guideline treatment group died or were severely disabled, compared to 52% of patients in the intensive treatment group, resulting in an OR 0.87 (95% CI 0.75 - 1.01). 

One of the secondary outcomes analyzed the entire mRS as an ordinal regression. When analyzed this way, the results were similar: cOR 0.87 (95% CI 0.77 - 1.00).

**Regardless of the method used to analyze the mRS, the results are consistent with a small benefit of intensive blood pressure lowering to reduce the risk of death or major disability.**

### Hematoma Expansion

The mechanism by which acute blood pressure lowering is thought to work is through the reduction in hematoma expansion. The trial protocol pre-specified a substudy of 600 patients with repeat imaging to evaluate hematoma expansion. 

There were 473 (guideline treatment group) and 491 (intensive treatment group) patients with repeat imaging available. 



## Final Thoughts

Blood Pressure trials or similar interventions are hard to conduct

People already had strong feelings about this given that the average BP was not much higher than 150 mmHg

While p-value did not cross the magical 0.05 threshold, the results were consistent with a beneficial effect of intensive blood pressure.

Don't know what to do with the QoL measures, as they were missing for many patients, and this likely was not at random.

Who are these people giving mannitol to patients that don't have IVH, are not intubated, and seem to have a fine GCS?

Hematoma expansion was not "significantly" reduced in the intensive group, but this may have been under powered.
