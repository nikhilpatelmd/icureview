patientPopulation: Acute primary ICH with SBP 150-220 mmHg within 6 hours of symptom onset
intervention: Target SBP < 140 mmHg
comparison: Target SBP < 180 mmHg
outcome: 'Death or major disability at 90 days: modified Rankin score 3-6'
pico: 'In patients presenting with acute primary ICH with an SBP of 150-220 mmHg within 6 hours of symptom onset, does intensive blood pressure lowering to a target of < 140 mmHg reduce the risk of death or major disability at 90 days as compared to a target SBP < 180 mmHg?'
gist: "INTERACT-2 was the first large, multicenter randomized trial to evaluate the effect of rapidly lowering blood pressure to a specific target in patients presenting with acute primary ICH.\n

‍2839 patients who presented within 6 hours of symptom onset were randomized to achieve a blood pressure target of < 180 mmHg (at the time, considered [guideline-based treatment](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.183689)) or < 140 mmHg (intensive blood pressure control).\n

At 90 days, 56% of patients in the guideline treatment group died or were severely disabled, compared to 52% of patients in the intensive treatment group (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 - 1.01). The results of this trial suggest that **blood pressure lowering to a target of < 140 mmHg probably has a small effect in reducing death and major disability in patients presenting with ICH**.\n

A similar trial, [ATACH-2](/trials/atach-2/), was published several years later. While the trial failed to replicate the findings of INTERACT-2, [this may be due to differences in achieved blood pressure and duration of blood pressure control](/trials/interact-2/#final-thoughts)."

## Clinical Context

The onset of ICH is often accompanied by an acute hypertensive response, which can reach very high levels and is associated with hematoma expansion and poor outcome. This relationship led to the theory that rapidly lowering blood pressure may reduce the risk of hematoma expansion and thus lower the risk of a poor outcome.

On the other hand, the potential benefit in reducing blood pressure must be balanced with the perceived risk of worsening cerebral perfusion, especially in patients with longstanding hypertension.

[Previous AHA/ASA Guidelines](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.183689) recommended maintaining an SBP < 180 and/or a MAP < 110 to balance reducing the risk of hematoma expansion and maintaining an adequate cerebral perfusion pressure. However, this was not based on any robust evidence as no high-quality studies had been conducted.

Published in 2013, INTERACT-2 was the first randomized trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of early intensive lowering of blood pressure on clinical outcomes.

## Patient Population

Patients were included if they presented with an ICH **within 6 hours of onset and had an initial systolic blood pressure of 150-220 mmHg**. They were excluded if they had an admission GCS of 3-5, were perceived to have a poor prognosis, or if early hematoma evacuation was planned.

The mean age of the population was about 63 years of age, with 2/3 being male and 2/3 also being recruited from China. Patients were also recruited from Europe, the United States, India, and South America.

**Most patients had mild to moderate ICH**: median GCS was 14 (IQR 12 - 15), median NIHSS was 10 (IQR 6 - 15) and median hematoma volume 11 mL (IQR 6-19) with approximately one-third of bleeds having intraventricular extension and the vast majority with a deep hematoma location (83%). Only about 7% of patients were intubated and 3% of patients had an EVD.

The average SBP on presentation was 179 mmHg. **This is lower than that seen in ATACH-2, where patients had an average SBP of 200 mmHg.**

## Study Design

This was a multicenter, international with a PROBE design involving > 100 sites.

### Protocol

Patients were randomized to either one of two groups:

**Interventional Group: intensive blood pressure control with goal SBP < 140.** This goal was chosen based on previous observational studies demonstrating that a target SBP < 140-150 is associated with less frequent hematoma expansion compared to a target SBP < 160-170.

**Control Group: guideline-recommended blood pressure control with goal SBP < 180.** This was based on contemporary AHA guidelines. No lower limit was specified.

Both groups were recommended to achieve goal SBP **within 1 hour of randomization and maintaining this goal for the next 7 days**. The specific medications used to control blood pressure were left to pre-specified local protocols, although it was recommended that the initial agent used for the intensive treatment group be an IV medication, while the initial one for the guideline treatment group be an oral medication.

All patients were cared for in an acute stroke unit.

A subset of patients (planned sample size of 600 patients, 300 Asian and 300 non-Asian) underwent repeat brain imaging at 24 hours to evaluate for any differences in hematoma expansion.

### Power Analysis

The trial was designed to have at least 90% power to detect a **14% RRR** and **7% ARR** in the primary outcome of mRS 3-6 at 90 days, assuming event rates of 50% in the control group and 43% in the intervention group.

While many trials are overly optimistic about the proposed effect size, I believe aiming for a 7% ARR is a reasonable expectation in this case.

## Results

### Achieved Blood Pressure

When a trial's main premise depends on manipulating a physiologic parameter, it's important to examine the achieved targets of said parameter.

In INTERACT-2, there was decent separation between the two groups as shown in the supplemental figure below. Note that the patients in the guideline treatment group had a mean SBP of around 150 mmHg, drastically lower than the < 180 mmHg target. This likely reflects that clinicians were already targeting an SBP goal lower than the AHA recommended level prior to the start of this trial (or they were influenced by the results of the pilot INTERACT trial).

### Death or Major Disability

The primary outcome of **mRS at 90 days** after symptom onset was dichotomized between 0-2 (good outcome) versus 3-6 (poor outcome). When analyzed this way, 56% of patients in the guideline treatment group died or were severely disabled, compared to 52% of patients in the intensive treatment group, resulting in an OR 0.87 (95% CI 0.75 - 1.01).

One of the secondary outcomes analyzed the entire mRS as an ordinal regression. When analyzed this way, the results were similar: cOR 0.87 (95% CI 0.77 - 1.00).

**Regardless of the method used to analyze the mRS, the results are consistent with a small benefit of intensive blood pressure lowering to reduce the risk of death or major disability.**

### Hematoma Expansion

The mechanism by which acute blood pressure lowering is thought to work is through the reduction in hematoma expansion. The trial protocol pre-specified a sub-study of 600 patients with repeat imaging to evaluate hematoma expansion.

There were 473 (guideline treatment group) and 491 (intensive treatment group) patients with repeat imaging available.

The study was unable to find evidence of a difference in hematoma growth at 24 hours with the current sample size.

### Safety Outcomes

The study was unable to find evidence of a difference in neurologic deterioration in the first 24 hours or other adverse events.

## Final Thoughts

INTERACT-2 was a major achievement, being the first RCT to attempt to answer the question of the optimal blood pressure target in patients with ICH. It was a well-powered, well-conducted study that has subsequently influenced practice and guideline recommendations.

There are a few points worth further discussion:

**Concluding that this study suggests no difference between groups based on the p value for the primary outcome being > 0.05 is incorrect.**
This is a common "absence of evidence does not equal evidence of absence" mistake. It ignores that the confidence intervals are largely compatible with a beneficial effect of intensive blood pressure control. See this post for further details and discussion.

**Despite being on opposite ends of the "0.05 threshold," analyzing the mRS results using an ordinal regression are consistent with the results of the dichotomized primary outcome. It was also pre-specified in the trial protocol and not added post-hoc.**

The results of the analysis are similar when analyzing the mRS as a dichotomous variable or as an ordinal variable:

(figure with ORs of both)

The differences between a p-value of 0.04 and 0.06 are not "significantly" different as the 95% CIs suggest.

Some readers have suggested that the ordinal regression was added after the trial had started. In fact, its use was prespecified in the protocol as a secondary outcome. See the [supplement from the NEJM page](https://doi.org/{{ doi }}).

**While there appears to be a probable benefit to intensive blood pressure control, the effect size is likely small.**
That's okay. It can still be important and worthwhile to do. You have to pick a blood pressure target anyway, and most of these patients will end up in the ICU, so more intensive blood pressure control is not a marginally expensive task.

It may be more important to control blood pressure in certain scenarios, such as patients who are at highest risk of hematoma expansion (present early, have deep location of ICH, or have a coagulopathy).

**The effect size could have been limited by the narrow differences in achieved blood pressure between groups.**
Clinicians likely had strong feelings about the intensive blood pressure control before the start of this study. This is reflected in the mean achieved SBP in the guideline treatment group being 150 mmHg, well below the recommended goal of < 180 mmHg. This is not a flaw in the study, but may have dampened the observed treatment effect by limiting the differences between groups.

**The lack of clear signal of a reduction in hematoma expansion is puzzling but may be due to decreased statistical power.**

**How do we reconcile the results with other studies?**
