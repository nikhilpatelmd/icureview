patientPopulation: Acute primary ICH with SBP >180 mmHg within 6 hours of symptom onset
intervention: Target SBP < 140 mmHg
comparison: Target SBP < 180 mmHg
outcome: 'Death or major disability at 90 days: modified Rankin score 3-6'
pico: "In patients presenting with acute primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) with a systolic blood pressure > 180 mm Hg, does lowering blood pressure to a target SBP of 110-139 mm Hg improve death or major disability at 90 days when compared to a target SBP of 140-179 mm Hg?"
gist: "Following the results of [INTERACT-2](/trials/interact-2) in 2013, many were encouraged about a probable beneficial effect of intensive blood pressure control on reducing the likelihood of death and disability in patients with ICH. ATACH-2 attempted to replicate these findings and potentially increase the effect size by using a single agent (nicardipine), trying to achieve BP control faster, and reducing BP even further.\n

**1000 patients** who presented within 4.5 hours of symptom onset with an SBP > 180 mmHg were enrolled and randomized to achieve a blood pressure target of **110-139 mm Hg (intensive treatment)** or **140-179 mm Hg (standard treatment)**. Enrollment was stopped after a prespecified analysis demonstrated futility.\n

At 3 months, 38% of patients in the standard treatment group were dead or severely disabled, compared to 39% of patients in the intensive treatment group **(RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.85 - 1.27)**. There was also a higher proportion of renal adverse events in the intensive treatment group (9% vs 4%, p = 0.002). While ATACH-2 was unable to replicate the results of INTERACT-2, this may have been due to the differences in achieved blood pressure between the two trials.\n

To balance the findings of the two trials and their post-hoc analyses, [AHA guidelines from 2022](https://doi.org/10.1161/STR.0000000000000407) have settled into recommending an **SBP of 130-150 mm Hg.**"

## Clinical Context

Following the results of [INTERACT-2](/trials/interact-2) published in 2013, many were encouraged about a probable beneficial effect of intensive blood pressure reduction on death and disability in ICH. The [2015 AHA Guidelines](https://doi.org/10.1161/str.0000000000000069) reflected this optimism by stating that "acute lowering of SBP to 140 mmHg is safe and can be effective for improving functional outcome" for patients presenting with SBP between 150-220 mmHg.

There remained some lingering concerns. Primarily, it was unclear how robust the benefit of intensive blood pressure lowering actually was, given the relatively wide confidence intervals for the primary outcome. From the perspective of clinicians in the United States, the external validity was also unclear given the large proportion of patients recruited from China and the corresponding frequent use of urapidil, a BP-lowering agent not available in the United States.

ATACH-2 attempted to replicate the results of INTERACT-2 with some modifications: using predominantly a single BP-lowering agent (nicardipine), enrolling patients earlier (within 4.5 hours compared to 6), trying to achieve BP control faster (within 1 hour of enrollment), and achieving even more aggressive BP control.

## Patient Population

Patients were included if they presented with an ICH **within 4.5 hours of symptom onset and had at least one SBP reading > 180 mm Hg**. They were excluded if the admission GCS was < 5 or ICH volume > 60 mL.

The average age of the population was 62 years of age, with roughly 2/3 being male and half the population recruited from Asia (China, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea). The other half were recruited from the US and Germany.

**Most patients had mild to moderate ICH**: over 80% of patients presented with a GCS 12 or greater, with median NIHSS of 11, and median ICH volume of 10 mL (10% of patients had a volume > 30 mL). Most had a deep location ICH (\~ 80%) and 1/4 had IVH.

This population is very similar to the INTERACT-2 cohort. **Unlike that trial, ATACH-2 did not have an SBP ceiling for recruitment, resulting in a higher SBP on presentation (200 mmHg vs. 179).** The other difference between the trials is the recruitment sites, with patients from China making up less of the cohort in ATACH-2.

## Study Design

This was a multicenter, international with a PROBE design involving > 100 sites.

* Average minimum SBP during the first 24 hours was very intense in both groups
* 

## Results

**Primary Outcome**: Death or major disability at 3 months as defined by <span class="color">modified Rankin score of 4-6</span>

(This is slightly different to [INTERACT-2](/interact-2), which used mRS 3-6 as the definition of poor outcome)
