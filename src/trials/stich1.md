patientPopulation: Acute primary ICH with SBP 150-220 mmHg within 6 hours of symptom onset
intervention: Target SBP < 140 mmHg
comparison: Target SBP < 180 mmHg
outcome: 'Death or major disability at 90 days: modified Rankin score 3-6'
pico: 'In patients presenting with acute primary ICH with an SBP of 150-220 mmHg within 6 hours of symptom onset, does intensive blood pressure lowering to a target of < 140 mmHg reduce the risk of death or major disability at 90 days as compared to a target SBP < 180 mmHg?'
gist: "INTERACT-2 was the first large, multicenter randomized trial to evaluate the effect of rapidly lowering blood pressure to a specific target in patients presenting with acute primary ICH.\n

‍2839 patients who presented within 6 hours of symptom onset were randomized to achieve a blood pressure target of < 180 mmHg (at the time, considered [guideline-based treatment](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.183689)) or < 140 mmHg (intensive blood pressure control).\n

At 90 days, 56% of patients in the guideline treatment group died or were severely disabled, compared to 52% of patients in the intensive treatment group (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 - 1.01). The results of this trial suggest that **blood pressure lowering to a target of < 140 mmHg probably has a small effect in reducing death and major disability in patients presenting with ICH**.\n

A similar trial, [ATACH-2](/trials/atach-2/), was published several years later. While the trial failed to replicate the findings of INTERACT-2, [this may be due to differences in achieved blood pressure and duration of blood pressure control](/trials/interact-2/#final-thoughts)."

## Clinical Context

The onset of ICH is often accompanied by an acute hypertensive response, which can reach very high levels and is associated with hematoma expansion and poor outcome. This relationship led to the theory that rapidly lowering blood pressure may reduce the risk of hematoma expansion and thus lower the risk of a poor outcome.

On the other hand, the potential benefit in reducing blood pressure must be balanced with the perceived risk of worsening cerebral perfusion, especially in patients with longstanding hypertension.

[Previous AHA/ASA Guidelines](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.183689) recommended maintaining an SBP < 180 and/or a MAP < 110 to balance reducing the risk of hematoma expansion and maintaining an adequate cerebral perfusion pressure. However, this was not based on any robust evidence as no high-quality studies had been conducted.

Published in 2013, INTERACT-2 was the first randomized trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of early intensive lowering of blood pressure on clinical outcomes.

## Patient Population

Patients were included if they presented with an ICH **within 6 hours of onset and had an initial systolic blood pressure of 150-220 mmHg**. They were excluded if they had an admission GCS of 3-5, were perceived to have a poor prognosis, or if early hematoma evacuation was planned.

The mean age of the population was about 63 years of age, with 2/3 being male and 2/3 also being recruited from China. Patients were also recruited from Europe, the United States, India, and South America.

**Most patients had mild to moderate ICH**: median GCS was 14 (IQR 12 - 15), median NIHSS was 10 (IQR 6 - 15) and median hematoma volume 11 mL (IQR 6-19) with approximately one-third of bleeds having intraventricular extension and the vast majority with a deep hematoma location (83%). Only about 7% of patients were intubated and 3% of patients had an EVD.
