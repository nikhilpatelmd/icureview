I am a practicing intensivist interested in improving my clinical care by continued reading, interpretation, and application of clinical trial findings into my practice.

This website serves as a method for me to organize and solidify my interpretations of the literature and how individual studies fit within the greater body of literature while also serving as an easy to access catalog of the major literature.

## Conflicts of Interest

I have no [financial conflicts of interest](https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/physician/5701805) from pharmaceutical or medical device companies.

I do have some biases that shape my interpretations. In no particular order:

- I completed residency in Neurology and Neurocritical Care and am certainly influenced by this perspective.
- In general I believe that when comparing two treatment strategies, if there isn't compelling evidence for one versus the other, I will favor the one that is less invasive, requires less nursing, financial, and cognitive resources, or is easier on the patient.
